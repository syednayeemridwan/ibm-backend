    "- Reduces overlapping responsibilities\n",
    "- Phases\n",
    "    1. Planning\n",
    "        - Identifying stakeholders, establishing objectives, REQUIREMENTS GATHERING, documenting, analyzing, prioritizing\n",
    "        - Users, purpose, input/outputs, legal compliance, risk, quality assurance, resource allocation, scheduling, cost against time constraints, roles of team members for producing Solution\n",
    "         - SRS Software Requirements Specification: functionalities, benchmark, purpose, scope, constraints, assumptions, dependencies\n",
    "         - URS User Requirements Specification: Business needs and end user expectations, Acceptance testing, Often combined with SRS. \n",
    "         - SysRS System Requirements Specification: Broader than SRS, include policy, regulations, security, performance\n",
    "        - Making prototype : small-scale replica to clarify requirement and test basic design ideas\n",
    "    2. Designing\n",
    "        - Requirements from SRS are gathered to develop architecture\n",
    "        - Translate SRS into language that can be converted to code\n",
    "        - Breaks down requirements into sets of related components\n",
    "        - Communicates business rules and application logics\n",
    "        - Prototype of the system can be developed to demonstrate the system \n",
    "        - The document in this phase is called Design Document which is used in the Development phase\n",
    "    3. Development\n",
    "        - When the developers start the coding process\n",
    "        - Ensures code quality : readable, testable, maintainable and secured. Efficient and well-documented nontheless.\n",
    "    4. Testing\n",
    "        - Code is thoroughly tested to ensure stability, security, performance, efficiency and requirement from SRS\n",
    "        - Bugs reported, tracked, fixed and re-tested. Also, gaps, errors and missing requirements are identified\n",
    "        - Can be automatic or manually\n",
    "        - eg: Unit testing (for component), integration testing (for integrated components), system testing (for larger product) and acceptance testing (beta testing by end users)\n",
    "    5. Deployment\n",
    "        - Application is released into the production environment for users\n",
    "        - Making software available for use\n",
    "        - Alpha relese : May contain errors, have most functionalities, design changes may occur, relesed to selected few\n",
    "        - Beta relese : Meets all requirements, goal is to test under real conditions, relesed to all stakeholders\n",
    "        - General Availability relese : Stable release for all users\n",
    "    5. Maintenance\n",
    "        - Find other bugs, issues, code enhancements, new and changing requirements"
